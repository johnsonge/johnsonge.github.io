title: Release early and often
---
   
The reading for today was on TOS's Chapter 9: Release Early, Release Often. This one page chapter talked about the textbook itself as an open source project. It encouraged constant revisions and additions like a software project would. After reading the chapter, I wasn't sure what to write about since it was only the one page with the link to the repository to contribute to being a dead one. On top of the dead link, a couple of the other links just lead to empty pages. I guess that's an indication that the repo isn't quite as active as they had intended it to be, unless I'm understanding its purpose wrong.

The book was overall pretty useful in my opinion. It covered enough about open source for use to get a feel for it. I feel like the exercises in the beginning of the book were very useful and stepped you through important parts of contributing to open source. On the other had, the exercises as the book progressed, felt very dated and overly confusing to get anything solid out of it. The most useful chapters to me were the ones on version control, getting involved in open source communities, and the one related to bug fixing. These were both helpful and relevant to our course work, and as I recall, had meaningful exercises that I used in similar situations during work on our project.

As a CS student who is very new to open source, I doubt I would be able to contribute anything meaningful to the book for the time being. Maybe in the future after a couple of years of experience with open source, I'll be able to contribute something helpful. There is definitely a lot of opportunities for submissions one could make to the book with bringing the exercises (or the websites that they are related to) up to date. I like that the chapter ends by saying "Remember: be bold. We will always have the option of reverting changes". I think that in the future, some team should use the TOS book as their 462 project. Even though it's not actual software, it would have lots to contribute to, which I feel is just as big a part of this class as the programming portions.
