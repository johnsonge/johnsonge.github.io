Finding bugs to work on for MuseScore has been both easy and difficult at the same time. Easy because there are plenty of bug submissions but difficult because lots of those are either very large fixes or they are getting fixed before we can get to it. Our team has had a couple of candidates for bug fixes and a couple of them seemed very promising, but then when we waited a couple of days to get together to fix it, but by that time it would already be fixed. What we're going to do is one of a couple of options. What we're trying to do now is dedicate a day to both finding and fixing a bug. This way, we don't risk having someone fix the bug that we had been planning to fix. What we don't want happening is that we'll start working on it and then a day later we realize that it has already been fixed. Our other option is to contact someone and ask them to assign us a bug if that's possible.


In terms of team progress, we are coming along pretty well. Although we haven’t had any actual meetings where we sat down, figured out a problem, and coded it out, from the looks of it, it will work out fine. I feel like we have a broad diversity in our team in terms of strengths and weaknesses, so I think that everyone will be able to play an important role in helping us to reach our goal of completing this project with as few issues as possible. One issue that we may come across is that since our project MuseScore is a music score writing and reading software, some of our team isn’t as familiar with music notation than others, so it may be more difficult to know how to fix the bugs without first getting up to speed on the musical jargon involved in score writing.
