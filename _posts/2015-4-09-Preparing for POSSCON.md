title: Preparing for POSSCON
---
This week we're preparing to go to POSSCON which is the Palmeto Open Source Software Conference. Our task is to choose three speakers who are presenting, attend their talks and then speak with them afterwards. Many of the presenters sounded like they would have interesting talks, but lowering it down to my top three choices was pretty easy. Many of the people were talking about different aspects and experiences, but the ones that I'm after are the ones with the most relevant experience working at companies that I know are doing big things.

<b>Semmy Purwal: </b><i>Netflix</i>

My first choice of presenters to see is Semmy. I talked to him during my 392 course in San Francisco and was really interested in what he had to say. He's an avid promoter of students putting a large emphasis on Javascript because of it's prevalence in Silicon Valley. After graduation, I'm wanting to put most of my focus that isn't on work, to Javascript, so talking to him seems like a good choice. We also had an opportunity to talk to him a little while back at the alumni symposium for our school and he mentioned more Javascript and Nodejs. He's always interesting to listen to and is a very relatable guy, he's the presenter that I'm most looking forward to hearing from at POSSCON.

<b>Jonathan LeBlanc: </b><i>Paypal</i>

The second speaker whose presentation I will be attending is Jonathan LeBlanc. He is an emmy award winning software engineer, and while I'm not sure what all that entails, it certainly sounds impressive. I've been using paypal for a good few years now, and I've always been impressed by them. I'm wanting to see what people who work there are like, what they do, and how they do it. There isn't much other information given about the speakers, so all we can do is judge books by their covers here, but this seems like a promising presentation as well.

<b>Dustan Kasten: </b><i>Skookum Digital Works</i>

My final choice of the three presenters whose talks we were to attend and then speak to, is Dustan Kasten. He works as a Web Developer at Skookum Digital Works. While I've bever heard about Skookum Digital Works, I'm interested in web development. I think that his talk will go well with Semmys and Jonathans in that they're working with web development in big companies, but I think that Dustan will be able to present on aspects that the others won't be touching on since he's coming from a digital studio.
