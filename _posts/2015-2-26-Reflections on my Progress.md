title: Reflections on my Progress
---
   
Well... Somewhere in between installing everything for the last assignment and now, I've managed to mess something up to where I can no longer build my project that I'm working on. I've tried testing different builds to see if it's just the current one that's not working, but none of them are working. Aside from the fact that I'm quite frustrated now, I'm pretty baffled as to why nothing is working. I'm getting an error that says..  I've looked into it a bit and some people have said that it occasionally has to do with firewalls, proxys, or what server you're on. I'm thinking that it may have something to do with when I set up the local server for the last assignment, it may have messed something up. I'm fairly certain that I've gone back and made sure everything in normal, but no luck so far. After a few hours of trying, I'm still getting the same error message at startup.

in stat: : No such file or directory
in stat: : No such file or directory
Init midi driver failed

Everything is working fine up until this point, it all compiles, it all builds into a package for xCode, xCode initializes everything, it builds without errors there, but then when I run it, I get the error, then it freezes at the bootup screen. One other person has had this issue, but it went unresolved. I'm going to try to track them down tomorrow and see if and how they fixed it. At this point, I'm just really hoping that I'm just being dumb and overlooking something big. I'm going to come back to it tomorrow and ask around to see what I've missed. I've got a promising bug that I'm ready to start fixing, so this odd setback is really coming at a inconvenient time.

In summary, progress was going pretty swimmingly up until now. The team got our first bug fixed and accepted relatively smoothly. I got my next bug picked out to start working on, figured out what I need to do to fix it, and then... brick wall. Walls like this always come up and it seems like the end of the world for a while, but sleeping on it, in my experience, has solved the problem about 90% of the time. So I'm giving that a go and then I'll report back on how I fixed it.

EDIT: Well it wasn't any network issue or anything. Just a break set in xCode that I now know to look out for.
