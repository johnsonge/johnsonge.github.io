<b>6.1. For the Person class, define a new pair of functions to set and retrieve the value of the variables $employer, $contact_person, and $contact_phone.</b>


For the most part, this exercise had already been completed with most of the getters and setters already in place. All I did was add in the missing ones using the same syntax as the others.

<br>
<b>6.2. Add four new parameters and corresponding assignments to the constructor for the Person class, so that the status, employer, contact person, and contact person’s phone are properly initialized.</b>

This exercise was already completed.

<br>
<b>6.3. The set_status function defined in this chapter does not check that the $value passed is valid: either active or inactive. Thus, whatever $value is passed becomes a Person’s status. Suggest a modification of this function that would perform that check.</b>

We could check what value the status is set to, pass it in as a parameter, and then set inactive to default.

<br>
<b>6.4. Refactor the existing Person class by removing all the mutators that are not called from anywhere in the code base.</b>

Looking through the Person class, all of the mutators that were once in place were now commented out. So deleting them would make it behave no differently that it already does. Leaving them commented out instead of completely deleting them seems like the better choice in case someone in the future wanted to use them for something.
