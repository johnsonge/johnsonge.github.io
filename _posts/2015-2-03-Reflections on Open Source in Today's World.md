[How I Landed a Job in Open Source](http://opensource.com/business/15/1/how-i-landed-job-open-source) - David Both, 30 Jan 2015
This article talked about the author's journey as a software engineer. He worked with a lot of big companies doing some pretty wide experience through it. Eventually he ended up cunsulting small businesses which he says is his most rewarding experience yet. It was interesting to see how his preferences shifted as he developed as an engineers and it's encouraging to see how many oportunities he had. I'm not sure where I want to end up as a programmer, but I like reading about people who have had lots of experience working in different places to see what fits with them the most.
