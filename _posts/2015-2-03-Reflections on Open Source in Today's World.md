title: Reflections on Open Source in Today's World 
---
   
TOS Chapter 5 was about building the cade for our open source project. Luckily, the process was relatively simple for our project with MuseScore because of the clear instructions and documentation. There was one issue with a command being left out, but that was al. I'm not sure if the command wasn't there or if it just wouldn't work for me if I didn't include it. One of my teammates also ran into the same problem when trying to get the code to build and it was fixed using the method I used, so I think that I'm going to fix that and submit it as a quick bug fix. At the very least, I'll try to talk to someone and ask them if it was actually a typo or if it's just something that was on my machine causing it not to work. The process of building Freeciv was a relatively straight forward process, just took a little while getting all the prerequisites and then finally running through all of the steps. I didn't run into any major issues though.

[How I Landed a Job in Open Source](http://opensource.com/business/15/1/how-i-landed-job-open-source) - David Both, 30 Jan 2015

This article talked about the author's journey as a software engineer. He worked with a lot of big companies doing some pretty wide experience through it. Eventually he ended up consulting small businesses, which he says is his most rewarding experience yet. It was interesting to see how his preferences shifted as he developed as an engineers and it's encouraging to see how many opportunities he had. I'm not sure where I want to end up as a programmer, but I like reading about people who have had lots of experience working in different places to see what fits with them the most.

[Good Design Matters for Open Source Projects]("http://opensource.com/life/15/2/good-design-matters-open-source-projects") - Rushabh Mehta, 02 Feb 2015 

When I was looking into reading articles, I thought this one would be interesting because it was about design. I initially thought it was talking about software design as in software architecture and design, but it was the actual UI and graphics that it was talking about. I was fine with that, it just caught me a bit of guard. The article talks about a project that they were working on and how they had a very bad looking design for their product and none of them were particularly good at design. ERP's (Enterprise Resource Planning), the author states, are notorious for "having the worst user designs". So for their product, they wanted to be sure that they didn't fall into the same trap. The summary of their journey was that it is, indeed possible to find good designers who work quickly and produce great work for a reasonable price.
