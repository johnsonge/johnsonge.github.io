title: POSSCON Report
---
The trip to POSSCON was an overall good experience, I attended the first day and was able to attend my previously targeted speeches as well as a few other interesting ones. The event was well organized and the presentations and meal transitioned smoothly. For the mostpart, it felt more like a general coding conference than it did open source. Many of the talks that I went to didn't even talk about open source, and the onles that did, usually only mentioned it in passing. I'm just going to mention my favorite three presenters in this blog post.

<br>
<b>Semmy Purewal: </b><i>Netflix</i>

One of the presentations that I attended was Semmy Purewal's. He talked about what's going on at Netflix and some of the architecture involved as well as some of what they went through for scaling. It was a very interesting talk and was well put together. Talking to him afterwards, he said some of the same that he mentioned before when I've talked to him. Which was to learn Javascript, because that's what people are looking for right now.

<b>Jonathan LeBlanc: </b><i>Paypal</i>

My next favorite speaker was Jonathan LeBlanc with his talk on "Killing all passwords". He gave several reasons why we should do this along with security and some others. He brought up some fun facts that I thought were interesting. He said something to the effect of if you tried to log in to someone's account with the top 100 passwords used, some rediculous percent of the time they'd succeed. And then on top of that, something like half of internet users use the same password for all of their logins. He went on to talk about different kinds of imbedded or ingestible technologies and their applications. It was all very interesting.

<b>Erica Stanley: </b><i>Acire Studios</i>

Another speaker that I found interesting was Erica Stanley. Her talk was on having everything eventually being connected to make the internet of things. While this is ambitious and all, I'm not sure how much we need any of that. The talk was interesting though, she went over some open source stuff that is contributing to the internet of things, what the advantages are and some other stuff. This wasn't really something that I'm into getting involved in or care to know much more about, but it was interesting enough.

We closed out the day with a talk about how open source was changing the world. And while I am 100% for open source, I felt like they tried to lay it on a little thick there in the end. The presenter talked about a lot of cool things going on with open source, but in between everything, he said something like "This is how open source is making the world a better place". Which is cool and all, but after the 4th or 5th time hearing it, it startes to feel like a Sarah McClachlan commercial.
