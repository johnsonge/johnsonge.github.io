title: Planning to Meet Charleston
---
   
For my team's meetup, we decided to attend the event "Tech After Five" on the 24 of this month. It's a Charleston tech networking event, so it seems like an interesting even to be going to. I'm thinking that on top of being good exposure to the Charleston tech community, it will also be good practice for making connections at POSSCON. Although I'm not entirely sure what all is involved with a tech meetup, I'm looking forward to it and will update this post with my experiences after the event.
